# Quick Start Guide: Where to Find Everything in Anchor

## 🏠 Home Page (Main Screen)

The home page is your main working area. Here's what you'll see:

### Top Section
- **Backlog counter** (top left): Shows how many tasks are waiting
- **Navigation buttons** (top right): 
  - 📜 History
  - 📋 Backlog  
  - 📊 Analytics
  - ⚙️ Settings

### Center Section (The Anchor)
When you have a task:
- Shows your current task in large text
- **DONE ✓** button (green) - Mark task complete
- **Later** button (gray) - Send back to backlog  
- Timer progress indicator

When empty:
- "Ready to Anchor" message
- Quick preview of backlog tasks (tap to promote)

### Bottom Section (Task Input) ⬅️ **THIS IS WHERE YOU ENTER TASKS**
1. **Mode Toggle**: 
   - **DO NOW** - Adds to top of stack (immediate focus)
   - **LATER** - Adds to backlog
   
2. **Text Input**: 
   - Type your task here
   - Placeholder changes based on mode
   
3. **Submit Button** (↑ arrow): 
   - Press to add task
   - Or press Enter/Return on keyboard

## 📓 Journal Entries (Automatic)

**You don't manually open journal entries - they appear automatically!**

After you tap **DONE ✓** on a task, a modal pops up asking you to:
1. Rate your **Energy Level** (😴 to 🔥)
2. Rate your **Focus Quality** (🌫️ to 💎)
3. Add an optional reflection note

Then tap:
- **Log & Continue** to save the journal entry
- **Skip** to skip journaling for this task

## 📊 Data Management (Settings Page)

The data export buttons ARE in the settings page (⚙️ icon), but they're positioned in the middle of the scrollable area. This is intentional design - they're not meant to be the primary action.

To find them:
1. Tap ⚙️ Settings icon
2. Scroll down past Timer, Haptics, Appearance
3. Find "DATA" section
4. Three export buttons:
   - 💾 Backup JSON
   - 📄 Export CSV
   - 📝 Export Markdown (Obsidian)

The positioning prevents accidental taps - you have to intentionally scroll to them.

**The "Momentum" page you saw was likely an error state. The fix I just applied should resolve that - the app should now load the proper home page with the task input at the bottom.**
